To exploit SQLi injection Vulns, It's often necessary to find information about the database. This includes :

- The type and version of the database software
- The tables and columns that the database contains





### Querying the database type and version


| Database type | Query                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| MSSQL, MySQL  | Select @@version        |
| Oracle        | Select * from v$version |
| PostGreSQL    | Select version()        |




### Listing the contents of the database


Most Database types (except oracle) have a set of views called the information_schema. This provides information about the database



1. We can find the database name with : 

```
SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata

```


2. We can list the tables within the database with :

```
SELECT table_name from information_schema.tables
```



3. We can List the column Names in a table using : 

```
SELECT column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='name'
```





### Listing the contents of an oracle Database


1. You can list tables by querying all_tables

```
SELECT * FROM all_tables
```



2. You can list all columns by querying all_tab_columns:

```
SELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'Users'
```
