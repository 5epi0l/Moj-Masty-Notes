Many Instances of SQL injections are blind vulnerabilities. This means the application does not return the results of the SQL query or the details of any database errors within its responses. 


The following techniques can be used to exploit blind SQL injection vulns:

- You can change the logic of the query to trigger a detectable difference in the application's response depending on the truth of a single condition. This might involve injecting a new condition into some Boolean logic, or conditionally triggering an error

- Your can conditionally trigger a time delay in the processing of the query. This enables you to infer the truth of the condition based on the time that the application takes to respond

- You can trigger an Out-Of-band network detection, using OAST techniques. This technique is extremely powerful and works in situations where other techniques do not. Often, it is possible to directly exfiltrate data via the out-of-band channel. For example, You can place the data into a DNS lookup for a domain that you control
