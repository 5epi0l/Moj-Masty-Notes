Consider a SQL query :


```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```


This SQL query asks the DB to return

- all details ( * )
- from the products table
- where the category is Gifts
- released is 1



If we are able to inject our malicious SQL statement  into the **category** param, we could possible make the application return 


```
https://website.com/products?category=gifts' OR 1=1--
```


Now, the  query in the backend becomes :

```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR 1=1--
```


Now Since 1=1 is always true, the entire SQL query becomes true. As a result, every entry from the DB is dumped
