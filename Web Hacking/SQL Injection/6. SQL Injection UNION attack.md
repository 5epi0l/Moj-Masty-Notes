When An application is vulnerable to SQLi, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the union keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database


The **UNION** keyword enables you to execute one or more additional **SELECT** queries and append the results to the original query



For example:

```
select p,q FROM table1 UNION select r,s FROM table2

```


This SQL query returns a single result with two columns, containing values from columns p and q in table1 and columns r and s in table2



For a **UNION** query to work, two key requirements must be met:

- The individual queries must return same number of columns
- The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries






### Determining the number of columns required


When performing a UNION attack, there are two effective methods to determine how many columns are being returned from the original query


- ORDER BY

```
' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER B
