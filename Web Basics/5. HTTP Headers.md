HTTP headers are used to pass information between the client and the server. Some headers are only used with either requests or responses, while some other general headers are common to both


Headers can have one or multiple values. We can divide headers into following categories


#### 1. General Headers

General Headers are used in both HTTP requests and responses. 

| Header     | Example                                | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date       | Date: Wed, 16 Feb<br>2022 10:38:44 GMT | Holds the date and time at which <br>the message originated                                                                                        |
| Connection | Connection: close                      | Dictates if the current network connection<br>should stay alive after the request finishes. Two<br>commonly used values are : Close and Keep-alive |




#### 2.  Entity Headers

Similar to General headers, Entity headers can be common to both the request and response. These headers are used to describe the content ( entity ) transferred by a message. 


| Header       | Example                     | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Type | Content-Type: text/html     | Describes the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browser on the client side |
| Media-Type   | Media-Type: application/pdf | Similar to the Content-Type header, it describes the data being transferred.                                         |
