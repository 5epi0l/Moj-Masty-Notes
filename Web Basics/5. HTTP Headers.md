HTTP headers are used to pass information between the client and the server. Some headers are only used with either requests or responses, while some other general headers are common to both


Headers can have one or multiple values. We can divide headers into following categories


#### 1. General Headers

General Headers are used in both HTTP requests and responses. 

| Header     | Example                                | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date       | Date: Wed, 16 Feb<br>2022 10:38:44 GMT | Holds the date and time at which <br>the message originated                                                                                        |
| Connection | Connection: close                      | Dictates if the current network connection<br>should stay alive after the request finishes. Two<br>commonly used values are : Close and Keep-alive |




#### 2.  Entity Headers

Similar to General headers, Entity headers can be common to both the request and response. These headers are used to describe the content ( entity ) transferred by a message. 


| Header           | Example                     | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Type     | Content-Type: text/html     | Describes the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browser on the client side                      |
| Media-Type       | Media-Type: application/pdf | Similar to the Content-Type header, it describes the data being transferred. It plays a crucial role in making the browser parse our data |
| Boundary         | boundary="b4e4fd93540"      | Acts as a marker to separate content.                                                                                                     |
| Content-Length   | Content-Length: 385         | Holds the size of the entity being passed.                                                                                                |
| Content-Encoding | Content-Encoding: gzip      | Defines the type  of encoding                                                                                                             |





#### 3. Request Headers

The client sends request headers in an HTTP transaction. These headers are used in an HTTP request and don't relate to the content of the message 


| Header     | Example                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host       | Host: www.google.com           | Used to specify the host being queried for<br>the resource. A single IP can host multiple hosts. Specifying the Host header value allows us to send the request to a specific host |
| User-Agent | User-Agent: curl/7.77.0        | Describes the client requesting the resources.                                                                                                                                     |
| Referer    | Referer: http://www.google.com | Denotes where the current HTTP req is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search would make  https://google.com the referer                                      |
| Accept     | Accept: image/jpeg             | Describes which media type the client can understand.                                                                                                                              |





#### 4. Response Headers

Response Headers can be used in HTTP response and do not relate to the content. 




| Header           | Example                                   | Description                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server           | Server: apache/2.2.14 (win32)             | Contains information about the HTTP server, which processed the request                                              |
| Set-Cookie       | Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540        | Contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests |
| WWW-Authenticate | WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="localhost" | Notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource.                      |
