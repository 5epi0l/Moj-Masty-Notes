HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the world Wide Web resources. The term hypertext stands for text containing links to other resources and text that the readers can easily interpret.

HTTP communications consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource. 






### URL

Resources over HTTP are accessed via a URL, which offers many more specifications than simply specifying a website we want to visit

```
http://admin:password@example.com:80/dashboard.php?login=true#status
```
