Kerberoasting is another popular attack pertinent to a Windows Domain Environment. Unlike ASREPRoasting, it is a post-authentication attack that requires access to a Domain User's account. It allows attackers to extract service account hashes and crack them to gain privileged access.



### SPN

 Every service in a Domain Environment is associated with a service account. SPN Stands for Service Principal Name. A SPN is a unique identifier that maps a service to a Domain Account. Basically it tells kerberos : "which user owns which service"



##### Do All Service Accounts have SPNs associated with them?

No, Not all service accounts have SPNs associated with them. A service account is granted an SPN only if:

1. It uses kerberos for authentication
2. It is a custom service account and not a builtin one (like LocalSystem, NetworkService etc)




### TGS

- A Service Ticket is a kerberos authentication token that allows a user to access a specific service within the domain (such as SMB, HTTP)
- A Service Ticket is issued by the TGS (Ticket Granting Service) which is a part of the KDC.



##### Requesting for a service ticket

- Any user with a Valid TGT can request a Service Ticket for a given SPN.
- The request contains : 
	- SPN of the service that the user wishes to access
	- Their TGT
- If the request is valid, the TGS issues a service ticket which is encrypted with the NTLM hash of the service account associated with the provided SPN.
- The service ticket can only be decrypted by the service account whose password hash was used to encrypt it





### Anatomy of kerberoasting

1. The attacker obtains a valid TGT by compromising a user account.
2. The attacker queries the AD for service accounts with SPNs.
3. The attacker requests for a service ticket as the compromised user.
4. The TGS responds with the service ticket encrypted with the password hash of the service account
5. The attacker takes the ticket offline, cracks it and potentially obtains the password for the service account.
