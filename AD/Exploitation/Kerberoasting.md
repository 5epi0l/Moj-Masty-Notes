Kerberoasting is another popular attack pertinent to a Windows Domain Environment. Unlike ASREPRoasting, it is a post-authentication attack that requires access to a Domain User's account.




### SPN

 Every service in a Domain Environment is associated with a service account. SPN Stands for Service Principal Name. A SPN is a unique identifier that maps a service to a Domain Account. Basically it tells kerberos : "which user owns which service"



##### Do All Service Accounts have SPNs associated with them?

No, Not all service accounts have SPNs associated with them. A service account is granted an SPN only if:

1. It uses kerberos for authentication
2. It is a custom service account and not a builtin one (like LocalSystem, NetworkService etc)
