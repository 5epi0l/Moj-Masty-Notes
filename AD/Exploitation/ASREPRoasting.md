- ASREPRoasting is one of the most popular attacks in an AD environment that allows an attacker to compromise accounts that have **kerberos pre-authentication** Disabled.
- It is a pre-authentication exploit, meaning an attacker can carry out ASREPRoasting, without access to credentials of any sort





### What the heck is Kerberos Pre-authentication?


Kerberos Pre-Auth is a security mechanism that ensures a user is actually who they clam to be before the KDC proceeds to issue them a TGT.

Without pre-auth, an attacker could :

- Send requests to the KDC pretending to be any user
- receive encrypted responses
- use bruteforce to crack the encrypted response to retrieve the user password.




### How Pre-Auth Works.


1. The user sends a TGT request to the KDC
2. The KDC requests for an identity verification
