Web Application layouts can consist of many different layers :

| Web Application Infrastructure | Describes the structure of required components, such as the database, needed for the web application to function as intended, Since these, web applications can be setup to run on a separate server, it is essential to know which DB it needs to access. |
| Web Application components     | The components that make up a web application represent all the components that the web application interacts with.                                                                                                                                        |
| Web Application Architecture   | Architecture Comprises all the relationships between the various WebApp components.                                                                                                                                                                        |




### Web Application Infrastructure



- Web applications can use many different Infrastructure setups, called models
- Most Common Models are :
	- **Client-Server** : In a client-server model, A server hosts a webapp and distributes it to any client trying to access it. 
	- **One Server** : In this model, the entire we
