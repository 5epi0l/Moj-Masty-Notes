- Service permissions are essential as weak permissions may server as potential threat vectors leading to execution of malicious executables or DLLs, privilege escalation etc.

## Principle of Least Privilege


The Principle Of Least Privilege is the concept that a user should only have access to what they absolutely need in order to perform their responsibilities and no more. 




## Examining Services using sc

The `sc qc` command is used to query the service. We can also use this to query a service on a different device on the network


```powershell
sc qc <service name> #queries the service on the local machine

sc //hostname or ip query Servicename #queries the service on a remote machine
```



We can also use `sc` to start and stop services

```powershell
sc stop <service_name>
```
