- Service permissions are essential as weak permissions may serve as potential threat vectors leading to execution of malicious executables or DLLs, privilege escalation etc.

- Most Services in Windows run with  the LocalSystem privileges which is the highest level of access on an individual Windows OS. 



## Principle of Least Privilege


The Principle Of Least Privilege is the concept that a user should only have access to what they absolutely need in order to perform their responsibilities and no more. 




## Examining Services using sc

The `sc qc` command is used to query the service. We can also use this to query a service on a different device on the network


```powershell
sc qc <service name> #queries the service on the local machine

sc //hostname or ip query Servicename #queries the service on a remote machine
```



We can also use `sc` to start and stop services

```powershell
sc stop <service_name>
```






## Examining service permissions using sc

```powershell
sc sdshow <service_name>
```


The output, at first glance, will seem like a random string. But it is the output of the permissions associated with the service expressed using the **SDDL** (Security Descriptor Definition Language)

- Every named object in Windows is securable object
- Securable objects are those that have a security descriptor associated with them
- Security Descriptors identify the owner's primary group containing Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) and System Access Control List (SACL)
- DACL is used for controlling access to an object and SACL is used to account for and log access attempts. 





## Examining Service Permissions using PowerShell

Using the Get-Acl Powershell cmdlet, we can examine service permissions by targeting the path of a specific service in the registry. 


```powershell
Get-ACL <path to the service in the registry> | Format-List

```
