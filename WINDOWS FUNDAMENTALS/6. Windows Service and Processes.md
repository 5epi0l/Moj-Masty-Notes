- Services are applications/processes that run in the background without the user's knowledge. 
- They typically start during boot automatically without user interventions. 
- They keep running even after the user logs out.


Services in Windows are managed via the `Service Control Manager (SCM)`, accessible via the `services.msc`.




## Querying services using the CLI


```powershell
Get-Services | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"}
```
