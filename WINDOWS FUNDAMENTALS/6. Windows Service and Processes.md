- Services are applications/processes that run in the background without the user's knowledge. 
- They typically start during boot automatically without user interventions. 
- They keep running even after the user logs out.


Services in Windows are managed via the `Service Control Manager (SCM)`, accessible via the `services.msc`.




## Querying services using the CLI


```powershell
Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"}
```




## Categories of Windows Services

Windows has three categories of services :

1. Local Services
2. Network Services
3. System Services




## Processes

- Processes run in the background of the windows systems. 
- They either run automatically as part of the Windows OS or are started by other applications




## LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)

- lsass.exe is the process that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows Systems.
- When a user tries to login, this process verifies their log on attempt and creates tokens based on the user's permission levels.
- LSASS is also responsible for user account password changes
- Passwords/hashes can be extracted from LSSAS's process memory
