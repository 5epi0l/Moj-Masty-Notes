### Security Identifier (SID)

A **SID (Security Identifier)** is a **unique, immutable identifier** that Windows assigns to:

- **Users**
    
- **Groups**
    
- **Computer accounts**
    
- **System services**

It’s how Windows keeps track of **who owns what** and **who has permission** to do what — not by name, but by this internal ID.
