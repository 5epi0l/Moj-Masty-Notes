The Server Message Block  Protocol (SMB) is used in windows to connect resources like files and printers. It is used in large, medium, and small enterprise environments.


NTFS Permissions and share permissions are thought to be the same, but they are not the same but often apply to the same shared resources




#### Share Permissions

#### Application of NTFS permissions and share permissions

- NTFS permissions apply to the system where the folder and files are kept
- Share permissions apply when the folder is being accesses through the SMB, typically from a different system over the network

This means someone accessing the system via RDP or physically will encounter NTFS permissions and a person accessing the folder via SMB will encounter share permissions.
