Sometimes we find that we are unable to run powershell scripts on a system. This is due to a security feature called the Execution Policy which attempts to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. The possible policies are : 




| Policy       | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AllSigned    | All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and config files.                                                                                   |
| Bypass       | No Scripts or config files are blocked, and the user receives no warning                                                                                           |
| Default      | This sets the default EP, restricted for Windows desktop machines and RemoteSigned for Windows Servers                                                             |
| RemoteSigned | Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet. Digital signatures are not required for scripts written locally |
| Restricted   | This allows individual commands, but doesn't allow scripts to be run                                                                                               |
| Undefined    | No Execution Policy is set for the current scope. If the EP for ALL scopes is undefined, then the default EP of Restricted will be used                            |
| Unrestricted | This is the default EP on non-windows PCs and it cannot be changed.                                                                                                |
