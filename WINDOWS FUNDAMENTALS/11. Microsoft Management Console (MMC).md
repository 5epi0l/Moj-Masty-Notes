**Microsoft Management Console (MMC)** is a **framework** that provides a common user interface for system management tools (called **snap-ins**) in Windows.


- **Snap-ins**: Plug-in tools that provide administrative functionality. Example snap-ins:
    
    - Device Manager
        
    - Event Viewer
        
    - Group Policy Editor
        
    - Disk Management
        
    - WMI Control



- **Custom Consoles (.msc files)**: You can save a specific setup of snap-ins in a .msc file and load it later. Examples:
    
    - compmgmt.msc (Computer Management)
        
    - services.msc (Services)
        
    - gpedit.msc (Group Policy Editor)
        
    - eventvwr.msc (Event Viewer)
