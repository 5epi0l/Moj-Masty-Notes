- WMI provides an interface to query and control system components in windows â€” such as processes, registry, settings, event logs, hardware, and much more.
- It allows for device and application management. 




### How WMI Works?

- WMI is based on the CIM (Common Information Model ) that treats system components(Here system components refers to processes, settings etc) as objects with properties and methods, much like a class in OOP.
- WMI interacts with these objects ( which are system components ) via the WMI provider model. 
	- Providers are DLLs or COM objects that server as an intermediary between WMI and the managed resources. ( eg. Win32_LogicalDIsk, Win32_Process etc )
- WMI has a local database of CMI schema and instance data
- WMI also supports system management across remote devices via DCOM




### Use Cases of WMI

1. System Monitoring : CPU, RAM, disk info
2. Remote system management
3. Automation of Administrative tasks
4. Log/event query




### WMI Abuse

WMI allows users to trigger actions when certain events occur (eg; when a new process starts). Attackers can leverage this as a potential persistence mechanism
