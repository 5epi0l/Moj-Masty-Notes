Socat is a bidirectional relay tool that can create pipe sockets between 2 independent network channels without needing to use SSH tunneling. It acts a redirector that can listen on one host and port and forward that data to another IP address and port



#### Setting up a redirector using socat

We can use socat to setup a redirector on the pivot box, that will redirect all traffic coming to a particular port to the attacker's machine

```bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:10.10.14.155:80
```


This command will make the pivot box listen on port 8080 for incoming traffic and r
