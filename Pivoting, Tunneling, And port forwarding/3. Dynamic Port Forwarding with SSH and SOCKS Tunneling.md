#### Port Forwarding

 - Port forwarding is a networking technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. 
 - Port Forwarding uses TCP as the primary protocol. However, different protocols such as SSH or SOCKS an be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. 





#### SSH Local Port Forwarding


- SSH Local port forwarding is a technique that allows us to make a remote service running on a remote host accessible to our local machine via SSH. 
- It maps the remote service port to a local port on our machine and tunnels all traffic sent to the local port to the remote port through the SSH session.
