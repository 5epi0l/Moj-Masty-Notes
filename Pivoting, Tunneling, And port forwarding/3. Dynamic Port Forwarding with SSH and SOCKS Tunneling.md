#### Port Forwarding

 - Port forwarding is a networking technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. 
 - Port Forwarding uses TCP as the primary protocol. However, different protocols such as SSH or SOCKS an be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. 





#### SSH Local Port Forwarding


- SSH Local port forwarding is a technique that allows us to make a remote service running on a remote host accessible to our local machine via SSH. 
- It maps the remote service port to a local port on our machine and tunnels all traffic sent to the local port to the remote port through the SSH session. 
- It is done to expose a **Remote Service** to the Local Machine




#### Syntax

```bash
ssh -L 1234:127.0.0.1:3306 username@hostname
```


The -L command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server  to forward all data that we send via the port `1234` to `localhost:3306` on the ubuntu server. 

Now, any traffic that we issue to our local port will be tunneled through the SSH connection to the remote port.




#### Dynamic Port Forwarding

Dynamic Port Forwarding is a network technique that allows us to turn a remote host into a proxy that will route traffic from the localhost to the internal network.
