#### IP Addressing and NICs

- Every computer communicating on a network needs an IP address
- The IP address is assigned in software and is usually obtained from a DHCP Server
- IP address is assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC)




#### Routing

- Routing is the process of selecting a path through which packets will travel in a network to reach the recipient.
- Every system has a routing table which helps the system in making routing decisions.
- When a packet is created and it has a destination, the routing table is used to decide where to send it.
