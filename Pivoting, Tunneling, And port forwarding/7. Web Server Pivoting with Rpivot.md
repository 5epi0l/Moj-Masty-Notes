- Rpivot is a reverseSOCKS proxy tool for SOCKS tunneling
- Rpivot binds a machine inside a corporate network to an external server and exposes the client's local port on the server-side

#### Scenario 

Youâ€™ve compromised a machine inside a **corporate internal network (Pivot Machine)**, which **cannot be accessed directly** from the outside due to a firewall. You want to access a service (say, an internal web server running on port 8080) that is **only available locally on that pivot machine**.

You control a **public VPS (Server)**, which is exposed to the internet and under your control. You also have access to the **attacker machine (Client)**.

You can use  rpivot to **expose port 8080 of the pivot machine to your attacker machine via your public VPS**
